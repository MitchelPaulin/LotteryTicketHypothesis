# Lesson 1

You usually want to do something like

```Python
from fastai.<FUNCTIONALITY> import *
```

at the start of most projects.

Lesson 1 discuss something called "fine grained image analysis" which means trying to distinguish between similar looking images, in this case dog and cat breeds. There are some helpful functions to download and prepare the images which you can see within the notebook.

## Training the Model

Once you have your set of labeled images, the first thing you need to do is normalize them. For example using a command like this.

```Python
data = ImageDataBunch.from_name_re(path_img, fnames, pat, ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, bs=bs
                                  ).normalize(imagenet_stats)
```

In this case all images are cropped to 224. The reason we do this is due to GPU limitations. In order to parallelize the learning processes on the GPU it needs to be able to operate on similarly sized things. You can see this operation returns an `ImageDataBunch`, this will automatically split up the data for you into a training and validation set, among other things.

The model we will be using for a base is **resnet34** which is the convolutional neural net architecture, resnet has also been pertained for recognizing images so it has some preset weights, this means we start with a model that is already "good" at classifying images, this reduces training time. The other popular one is **resnet50** which has more layers but a large increase in training time. For most uses resnet34 seems adequate.

```Python
learn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet34, metrics=error_rate)
```

And now that we have a learner we can, well, make it learn.

```Python
learn.fit_one_cycle(4)  # 4 means do 4 epochs
```

Now we have a trained model, and we get an error rate. One thing we may want to do is look at what we got wrong.

```Python
interp.plot_top_losses(9, figsize=(15,11))
```

This will show us a set of images and our incorrect guesses. Another way to visualize this is with something called a confusion matrix. It shows us categories that we often mix up.

```Python
interp.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(12,12), dpi=60)
```

## Improving The Model

One way to improve the model is to run more training cycles, this can give you more accurate predictions. You want to be careful however to avoid something called *overfitting*. Where a model only recognizes the specific set of images it was trained on and it not very good at recognizing other images of the same class.

Its important to understand what we are doing is something called **Transfer learning**. This means we are taking a model that is already good at recognizing something similar to what we are trying to do and train it further to recognize the thing we care about. This can drastically reduce learning times. A function called `unfreeze()` allows you to train the whole model from scratch.

```Python
learn.unfreeze()
learn.fit_one_cycle(1)
```

This however makes it very slow and in the case of lesson1, lead to much worse error rates.

It sounds like we go into more detail about each of these topics later in the course, so details here were left generic on purpose.
