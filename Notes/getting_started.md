# Getting Started

## First Time Setup

To create a new fast.ai instance first install the gcloud platform then run `createNewInstance.sh`.

## Connecting To Your Instance

1. First ensure the instance is running [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute), if its now running, start it.
2. If the instance is running you can connect to it by running `setup.sh`. You should see the terminal prompt change to something like `jupyter@my-fastai-instance`
3. If everything worked connect to the instance [here](http://localhost:8080/tree)
4. Don't forget to the stop the instance when you are done.
