# Transformations, pre processors
# Categorify: What this does is it will analyze a column, and if it sees that a column is made up of discrete categories, it will assign an integer to each of those categories and replace what was originally in the column with an integer.
# Fill Missing: This will create, for anything that has a missing value an extra column is created which is set to True if the data is provided and False if it is not. We do this because very often the fact that this particular piece of data is missing is interesting and will help us make better predictions.
